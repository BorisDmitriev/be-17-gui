# Database operations with graphical user interface

## Introduction

In this exercise you will learn how to use the Graphical User Interface (GUI) for MongoDB (Compass) and MySQL (Workbench). You will use a MongoDB and a MySQL database to insert, query, update and delete movie data.

## Assignment for MongoDB Compass

You are to create a simple movie database using MongoDB Compass and perform various operations on it.

### Task 1: Adding movies to MongoDB Compass

Create a collection named "movies" and add three movies as documents to the collection. Each movie should contain fields like `director`, `title`, `genre` and `year`. Use the `insertMany()` method.

### Task 2: Querying movies in MongoDB Compass

Find all movies that belong to the genre "fantasy". Use the `find()` method.

### Task 3: Updating movies in MongoDB Compass

Update the author of the first movie. Change the value of the `author` field to "John Doe". Use the `updateOne()` method.

### Task 4: Deleting movies in MongoDB Compass

Delete the third movie from the collection.

## MySQL Workbench task

You are to create a simple movie database using MySQL and perform various operations on it. Use the MySQL syntax for the operations.

### Task 5: Inserting movies into MySQL Workbench

Create a table named "movies" and insert three movies as records into the table. Each movie should contain fields like `director`, `title`, `genre` and `year`. Use the syntax `INSERT INTO` and `VALUES`.

### Task 6: Querying movies in MySQL Workbench

Find all movies that belong to the genre "fantasy". Use the syntax `SELECT * FROM` and `WHERE`.

### Task 7: Updating movies in MySQL Workbench

Update the author of the first movie. Change the value of the `director` field to `John Doe`. Use the `UPDATE` and `SET` syntax.

### Task 8: Deleting movies in MySQL Workbench

Delete the third movie from the table. Use the syntax `DELETE FROM` and `WHERE`.
